Hi, I’m @jjzsilva9 <br>
I’m interested in AI, Game Development and other high level programming <br>
I’m currently learning Artificial Intelligence with Python in CS50AI. I have already completed CS50x, CS50GD and CS50W, so this github is mainly used for those as well as important code for my A-level in computer science.

I plan to get a massive streak on Github activities, the exception to this will be sundays which can be days off.
