Hi, I’m @jjzsilva9 <br>
I’m interested in AI, Game Development and other high level programming <br>
I’m currently learning Web development with the Django framework <br>
I am currently doing CS50W and plan to take CS50AI in the near future <br>
I plan to get a massive streak on Github activities as I have a big final project which I need to start coding, the exception to this will be sundays which can be days off
