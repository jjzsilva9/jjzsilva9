Hi, I’m @jjzsilva9 <br>
I’m currently learning Artificial Intelligence with Python in CS50AI, although I am currently revising for exams so I have put this on hold. I have already completed CS50x, CS50GD and CS50W, so this github is mainly used for those as well as important code for my A-level in computer science.
